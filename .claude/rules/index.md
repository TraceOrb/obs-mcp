description: Only rule file Claude auto-loads — index of Traceorb rules in saas-plano
alwaysApply: true

# Rule index (mandatory)

`.cursor/rules/` and `.claude/rules/` contain **only this file**. Every other rule lives in `saas-plano`. Do not look for rules under these folders besides the index. Do not copy rules into `.ai-rules/`.

The Cursor workspace is the parent folder `observability`. Read with that path. If this repo is open alone, prefix with `../`.

Before writing or changing code: **Read** the always-on files below. Then, if the task matches a row, Read that file too. Do not Read the rest.

## Always — Read these now (every task)

| File | What it enforces |
|------|------------------|
| `saas-plano/05-architecture/dev/rules/code-style-rules.md` | Mappers, no comments, no ternary, no else |
| `saas-plano/05-architecture/dev/rules/typing-rules.md` | Strict TS, no `any`, no `as`, closed Record |
| `saas-plano/05-architecture/dev/rules/testing-rules.md` | Spec for new or changed behavior |
| `saas-plano/05-architecture/dev/rules/commit-rules.md` | Conventional Commits; agent commits, person publishes |
| `saas-plano/05-architecture/dev/rules/security-rules.md` | Org isolation; read key only reads; MCP never sees ClickHouse |

## On demand — Read only if the task matches

| When you are… | Read |
|---------------|------|
| Adding or changing an MCP tool | `saas-plano/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-22-read-key-mcp-design.md` |
| Publishing the package or changing CI | `saas-plano/05-architecture/dev/rules/deployment-rules.md` |

If two on-demand rows match, Read both. If none match, stop after the always-on files.
